Design
1.	What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
My group used an agile approach to create our SlackBot where the execution software was created first and then everyone was assigned one or more user stories to complete which we ended up testing in the last step. It was really helpful that the user stories didn’t depend on each other so that all of us could complete it on our own pace and an error in one user story would cause another story to fail. 

2.	What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
While we used an agile coding approach, we could’ve been better at communicating. A lot of it happened over text which made it hard for the team members to see the messages right away, as well as to fully understand which changes have been added to the code. Later on, we used Zoom and Google Meets to check and test the user stories which I liked a lot more. However, it would’ve been helpful to take short notes about what everyone is supposed to complete by the next meeting, as well as text in the group chat once a user story is finished. 

3.	What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
I really liked the agile approach we used as it allowed us to work more individually. In particular, I liked the clear distinction between each user story so that everyone had their individual little project to work on, once the execution file war written. While we used elements of scrum, I would like to add the standup meetings to my next project to make communication easier. For my group, 10 min before or after class was a lot easier to schedule that 1-2h where the whole team was working on code together. 


Implementation
1.	What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?
Will created the program which ran with the ngrok api early on so all the rest of the group had to focus on were the user stories. Those could be written individually and commented out when any mistakes existed. 

2.	What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
We decided to use the ngrok api to connect commands on slack with the database outputs we created. Since it was Will alone who wrote the code, we would’ve had a hard time fixing any mistakes in the code or updating it based on our needs. Peer coding could have been a safer alternative.

3.	What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
I really like the usage of individual user stories because every team member is assigned their own function and complete at their own pace and complexity. 


Process
1.	What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?
Kanban was really helpful to record any progress and review any changes made. However, our group did not code review our project but one of Zack’s personal websites so this is something I definitely want to implement in my next project.

2.	What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
Due to our inefficient communication it was to stay informed about any changes made without checking the github directly. Furthermore, I would have like more regular meetings that were planned better in advance.

3.	What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
I want to use Kanban again and add a more visual display of all tasks completed, in progress or done. Additionally, I like the idea of user stories whose completion or correct execution doesn’t affect whether the rest of the code works.
